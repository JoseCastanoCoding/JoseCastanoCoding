# Hola there! üëã

## Who am I ? 


üë®‚Äçüíª My name is `Jose` and I'm a Junior Software Developer with 8 months of experience within the **.NET** space. My primary focus is on C#, ASP.NET, and MVC, and I am very enthusiastic about learning new technologies and frameworks. My goal is to master the tech stack I am currently using and I am fully determined to do so! 

üìö I dived into software development in August 2020 and since then I fell in love ‚ù§ with it! I enroled in a Professional Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with the Code Institute of Ireland and learned the basic foundations of front-end development using declarative languages like HTML and CSS and programming languages like Javascript and Python. I very much enjoyed learning and utilizing frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery and Django for some of the projects I created throughout my studies.

üéß Outside the world of tech too, I I am a vinyl collector and have an eclectic taste in music ‚Äì I will listen to anything, but electronic music stole my heart when I was 14 years old and my love for the genre was reignited on arrival in the UK when I discovered London‚Äôs nightlife and music scene. I have over 1000‚Äôs of vinyl in my collection.
